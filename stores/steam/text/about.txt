Krita is a powerful digital painting and animation application designed for illustrators, designers, comic makers, animators, game artists and more. It’s used all over the world by artists of every level: from absolute beginners to seasoned professionals.

One big thing that sets Krita apart is that it’s [i]fully open source and community-driven[/i]. This means that it’s developed transparently in coordination with a global community of volunteer artists and programmers, working together to make a great tool for everyone. There are no activation codes, mandatory subscription fees or other roadblocks, because as members of the digital art community, Krita belongs to all of us--to use, to modify, to design and to share.

Krita’s unique development model is only made possible thanks to the support of our users, and [i]by buying through Steam you will be directly supporting Krita's future development[/i]. What’s more, buying Krita through Steam also brings the convenience of [i]easy installation[/i] on all your supported devices and [i]automatic updates[/i] each time a new version is released.

Finally, because Krita is an open source and community-driven project you will always have full access and rights to download and modify Krita's source code; whether you want to modify it for personal use, or work with the community to make Krita better for everyone. You can also download Krita for free from the Krita Foundation website (of course, without any of the benefits of owning through Steam). In order to create a potent tool for artists everywhere, we believe it has to be not only open source but also accessible to as many people as possible no matter their situation and resources. As such, for those who maybe can’t afford Krita or are still unsure about supporting our work, we encourage you to try it out first, hopefully supporting us later if you can, and only because you want to.

There's truly no limit to what Krita can be if we work together as a community.

[h2]Key Features[/h2]

[b]Powerful Brush Engines[/b]

Over a dozen different brush engines, supporting pressure sensitivity, tilt, rotation and other features of modern graphics tablets. Standard brushes, texture masked brushes, blender brushes, clone brushes, filter brushes, and many more! Every single one of them can be turned into an eraser or use any of the various blending modes. Krita includes over a hundred default brushes carefully produced or curated by professional artists, with many more available from the community online.

Krita's unique pop-up palette and canvas-only mode allows you to hide almost all of the UI and immerse yourself in your artwork, putting brush preset selection, color selection, canvas adjustment and brush tweaks right at the tip of your pen.
