Krita 2.9 will be released on Wednesday 

Hi!

Wednesday, Feburary 26th, we're going to release version 2.9.0 of Krita, the award-winning free and open source digial painting application. It's the biggest release we've ever had. Here's a link to the full changelog (which will be made public on Wednesday, so please keep it under wraps until then!)

https://krita.org/krita-2-9-the-kickstarter-release/

The biggest highlights:

* We implemented eleven out of twelve of the features funded by our first kickstarter (the twelfth is coming in 2.9.1) See https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-open-source-digital-painting-accelerate-deve and 
https://krita.org/item/the-votes-are-in/.

* Krita now supports loading and showing multiple images in one window, and viewing any given image in multiple views and windows.

* Krita now fully integrates the G'Mic set of image manipulation tools, enabling artists to, for instance, greatly speed-up their workflow: http://www.davidrevoy.com/article247/krita-2-9-comic-coloring-tutorial.

* Support for painting in HDR mode got greatly extended, making it a true creative tool.

And there's much, much more, ranging from new perspective painting assistants to new color selectors, improved transform tools and non-destructive transformation masks, brush engine improvements, workflow improvements, new filters, support for creating and installing resource packs (brushes, gradients, patterns and so on).

In January, ImagineFX, the biggest print magazine for creative artists and illustrators already awarded Krita their Artists' Choice accolade: https://krita.org/item/krita-receives-artist-choice-award-from-imaginefx/.
